My certificate from the Programming BootCamp: [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/Knaus-Elias-Gustavo/scientific-computing-with-python-v7)


#### Technologies Used: Python 3.10 - VSCode (IDE)

### Project Descriptions: 

**Arithmetic Formatter**:
For the set of functions and the class in the `arithmetic_arranger.py` file:
Develop a function that arranges and formats arithmetic problems in vertical lines, providing a clear and orderly visualization of mathematical operations. Additionally, it can optionally display the answers for each problem. It is ideal for the visualization and resolution of simple mathematical problems.

**Budget App**:
For the set of functions and the class in the `budget.py` file:
This file contains functions and a class useful for managing spending categories and generating bar "charts" representing the percentage of spending by category. The functions include total calculations and truncations, while the `Category` class offers methods for depositing, withdrawing, transferring funds, and checking balances. It is ideal for financial management applications and visualization of spending data.

**Polygon Area Calculator**:
For the `Rectangle` and `Square` classes in the `shape_calculator.py` file:
This file provides the implementation of the `Rectangle` and `Square` classes to model geometric shapes in a two-dimensional plane. The `Rectangle` class represents a rectangle with methods to calculate area, perimeter, diagonal, and generate a graphical representation. The `Square` class is a subclass of `Rectangle` and represents a square, inheriting the methods and attributes of the `Rectangle` class, but with an additional method to set the side of the square.

**Probability Calculator**:
For the `Hat` class and the `experiment` function in the `prob_calculator.py` file:
This file presents a `Hat` class that simulates a hat with balls of different colors. The class allows adding balls of different colors and then drawing a specific number of balls at random. Additionally, it provides an `experiment` function to perform simulations of drawing balls from a hat, calculating the probability of drawing a specific combination of balls after a certain number of experiments.

**Time Calculator**:
For the `add_time` function in the `time_calculator.py` file:
The `add_time` function takes a start time, a duration, and optionally a day of the week, and calculates the new time after adding the duration. It can handle both 12-hour and 24-hour formats and returns the new time in 12-hour format, along with the day of the week if provided. Additionally, it indicates if an additional day has passed since the initial time.

##### Conclusion
These experiences have been fundamental in enhancing my skills in programming, data manipulation, and solving computational problems with Python. If you want to explore and test these projects, I recommend compiling and running the main .py files, as they load the base functions I developed to meet the specific requirements.

If you want to see the core code, you should look within the functions in other .py files, ignoring the test and main .py files.
